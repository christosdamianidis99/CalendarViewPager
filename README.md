# CalendarViewPager

## Description
My app is a calendar that features month, week, and day views, along with a list view for events. The main advantage is that it is built with ViewPager and utilizes Canvas for a lightweight and modern UI.

## Features
- Month, week, and day views
- List view for events
- All CRUD operations for events via DatabaseHelper
- Pop-up window for fast navigation
- Reminder functionality with notifications

## Technologies Used
- Android Studio (Java)
- ViewPager2


## Usage
Users can navigate through the calendar in every view (month, week, and day), create events with custom durations, and add reminders for notifications. To interact with the app:

1. **Navigate to Calendar**: Use the ViewPager to switch between month, week, and day views.
2. **Create Events**: Tap on a date to open the event creation dialog. You can specify the event's duration and details.
3. **View Events**: Access the list view to see all created events.
4. **Edit/Delete Events**: Long-press on an event to edit or delete it.
5. **Set Reminders**: When creating or editing an event, you can set reminders that will trigger notifications.
